# train
This is a small application to control my hobby trains h0.
Switches are controlled by using snmp board from denkovi.com and hopefully soon with raspberry.

<h3>Missing Libs</h3>
To use SNMP library provided by denkovi there are several jars not in maven main repo. To provide this install it with
SNMPAPI/jars/installToMvn.sh
probably this shellscript must be adapted.
